# 📘 Schedule Schema Definitions

This section defines how schedules are represented in memory and in the final output.  
It describes all key entities, scheduling rules, and teaching type semantics used when generating or validating school timetables.

## Definitions

- Class: A homeroom-based student group. Identifier format: `<grade>/<section>`.  
  Example: `"1/1"`.
- Subject: A course being taught. Identifier format: `<DeptLetter><5-digit code>`.  
  Example: `"M10010"`.
- Teacher: Instructor responsible for lessons. Identifier format: `"T###"`.  
  Example: `"T001"`.
- Room: A physical teaching location, such as `"1001"`, `"COM1"`, `"GYM"`.
- Period: The smallest unit of scheduled teaching time defined by the school.
- Slot: A unique scheduled period identified by `Day + Period` index.  
  Format: `"<DAY>_<PERIOD>"`, e.g. `"MON_1"`.
- Group: A subgroup within a slot when teaching requires splits or multiple groups.  
  Each group may have its own teacher(s), room(s), or class subset(s).
- Constraints: Optional rules affecting scheduling.  
  Examples: fixed period requirement, specific room, or teaching format rules such as `SPLIT` or `TEAM`.

## Scheduling Rules
Scheduling determines how classes, teachers, rooms, and subjects are assigned into time slots across the week.

### General Principles
- Each schedule entry represents one slot assignment — one unique combination of day and period.  
- A Class, Teacher, or Room can appear in only one slot at any given time.  
  - No overlapping assignments are allowed.  
  - Every slot must respect this exclusivity rule.

### Structural Consistency
- Every slot must strictly follow the schedule schema defined above.  
- Each slot must include valid and complete information for:
  - `subject_id`
  - `class_ids`
  - `teacher_ids`
  - `room_ids`
  - `teaching_type`
  - `groups`

### Behavioral Rules
- Groups inside a slot must follow the rules of their assigned teaching_type.  
  For example, *Standard* has one class and one teacher, while *Split* has multiple groups with different teachers or rooms.
- All assigned classes, teachers, and rooms must correspond correctly within their groups.  
- Constraints such as fixed periods, specific rooms, or pre-defined blocks must be fully respected.

### Integrity & Validation
- Ensure no overlap across all entities:  
  - No class is scheduled twice at the same time.  
  - No teacher teaches in two places simultaneously.  
  - No room hosts more than one session at once.
- Always maintain logical consistency between `slot.class_ids` and each group’s content.
- If any ambiguity or undefined constraint occurs, ask for clarification instead of making assumptions.

## Schedule Standard Format

Each schedule entry is represented as a slot record.

Each `Class`, `Teacher`, and `Room` can appear in only one subject per slot.  
These entities are linked together within a unified structure.

```json
{
  "schedule_id": "SCHEDULE_ID",
  "slot_id": "DAY_PERIOD",
  "subject_id": "SUBJECT",
  "teaching_type": "TYPE",
  "class_ids": [],
  "groups": [
    {
      "group_id": 1,
      "class_ids": [],
      "teacher_ids": [],
      "room_ids": [],
      "constraints": []
    }
  ]
}

```

Field Descriptions:
- `schedule_id`: Unique identifier for the generated timetable.
- `slot_id`: Unique slot identifier containing day and period information.
- `subject_id`: Identifier of the subject taught in that slot.
- `teaching_type`: One of the predefined teaching types (see below).
- `class_ids`: List of all classes participating in that slot.
- `groups`: List of one or more teaching groups under that slot.
Each group contains:
- `group_id`: Unique number within the slot.
- `class_ids`: Class(es) assigned to that group (may be empty for full splits).
- `teacher_ids`: Assigned teachers.
- `room_ids`: Assigned rooms.
- `constraints`: Optional extra conditions applied to the group.

## Teaching Types
Teaching types define how classes, teachers, and rooms are arranged within a slot.
Each type determines the valid structure of groups and constraints.
Teaching type is written as type=<teaching_type> inside constraints.
Must be one of the following:

### Standard
- One class is taught by one teacher in one room.
- slot.class_ids contains exactly one class.
- groups has exactly one group.
- That group includes the same class_id, exactly one teacher_id, and one room_id.
### Team
- One class is taught by multiple teachers together in one room.
- slot.class_ids contains exactly one class.
- groups has exactly one group.
- That group contains one class_id, multiple teacher_ids, and one room_id.
- The constraint “TEAM” must be included.
### Split
- One class is split into multiple subgroups.
- slot.class_ids contains exactly one class.
- groups contains multiple groups.
- Each group does not specify class_ids (empty) because they represent subgroups of the same class.
- Teachers and rooms must differ per subgroup.
- The constraint “SPLIT” must be included.
### Multi-Class
- Multiple classes share a single teacher in one room.
- slot.class_ids lists two or more classes.
- groups has exactly one group.
- That group has the same class_ids as the slot, one teacher_id, one room_id.
- The constraint “MULTI” must be included.
### Multi-Class Team
- Multiple classes share multiple teachers in one room.
- slot.class_ids lists two or more classes.
- groups has exactly one group.
- Group contains multiple teacher_ids and one room_id.
- The constraint “MULTI-TEAM” must be included.
### Subgroup
- Subgroup teaching where participants may differ across groups.
- slot.class_ids contains two or more classes.
- groups has multiple groups.
- The constraint “SUBGROUP” must be included.
#### Subgroup possible cases:
- Case A: class-based subgroups
    Each group serves one or more classes.
    group.class_ids contains at least one class per group.
- Case B: student-choice subgroups
    Subgroups are independent of class boundaries.
    group.class_ids may be empty, indicating mixed or elective-based grouping.

## General rules for all teaching types:
- All group.class_ids must be a subset of slot.class_ids, unless empty for split/elective cases.
- All teacher_ids and room_ids must be unique within the slot, unless sharing is explicitly allowed (e.g. Team, Multi-Class Team).
- Every class and teacher assigned to a slot must belong to at least one group.
- Each slot must satisfy period and room constraints as defined in the input data.

# School Timetable Pre-Scheduling Instructions

Your task in this step is to create a pre-schedule for all fixed slots before the main timetable generation.  
This pre-schedule defines all non-negotiable (pre-placed, unavailable, scout, and elective) slots for student classes, teachers, and rooms.

---

## Step 1: Generate Empty Schedules
- Read Sheet 4: Period (คาบเรียน) for the time slots.
- Use it to generate empty schedules for:
  - All student classes
  - All internal teachers
  - All external teachers
  - All rooms
- The empty schedules should follow the same structure as the input:
  - Rows represent weekdays (Monday–Friday)
  - Columns represent periods (with the exact period names from the sheet, e.g., “Morning Break”, “Lunch”)
- At this stage, all slots are unassigned.

---

## Step 2: Apply Pre-Placed Slots
- From Sheet 4, locate all rows as Pre-place slots.
- For each pre-placed slot:
  - Apply it to the related student classes.
  - If `apply_to = All`, apply that slot to all student classes and teachers.

---

## Step 3: Mark Teacher Availability
- Open Sheet 3: Teacher (ครู).

### For Internal Teachers:
- Read the `unavailable_slots` column.
- Mark all listed slots as unavailable in their schedule.
- These unavailable slots must also be treated as occupied when checking for overlaps.

### For External Teachers:
- Read the `available_slots` column.
- Mark all slots except those listed as unavailable.

## Step 4: Assign Scout (ลูกเสือ) Sessions
- Read Sheet 7: Scout (ลูกเสือ).

For each level:
- ลูกเสือ ม.1 (Scout M.1) → Find the corresponding teacher(s) listed under this column.
  - Mark all Scout M.1 slots (as defined in Sheet 4) in their schedules.
- Repeat the same for:
  - ลูกเสือ ม.2 (Scout M.2)
  - ลูกเสือ ม.3 (Scout M.3)

---

## Step 5: Schedule Elective Courses
- Read Sheet 2: Elective (วิชาเลือก).

For each elective subject:
1. Identify the teacher assigned to it.
2. Locate the elective slots (defined in Sheet 4).
3. Schedule the elective course in:
   - The teacher’s schedule
   - The corresponding class’s schedule
   - The room’s schedule
4. Set the value in the assigned slots to 1 to mark the elective course.
5. Ensure all schedules remain conflict-free across teachers, rooms, and classes.

✅ Goal:  
After completing these steps, you should have a fully populated pre-schedule that includes all fixed slots and unavailabilities, ready for the next phase of automated timetable generation.
